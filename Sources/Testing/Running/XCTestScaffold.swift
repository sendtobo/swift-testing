  ///
  /// - Parameters:
  ///   - testCase: An `XCTestCase` instance that hosts tests implemented using
  ///     the testing library.
  ///
  /// Output from the testing library is written to the standard error stream.
  /// The format of the output is not meant to be machine-readable and is

  ///
  /// ### Filtering tests
  ///
  /// This function does not support the `--filter` argument passed to
  /// `swift test`. Instead, use one of several environment variables to control
  /// which tests run.
  ///
  /// #### Filtering by ID
  ///
  /// To run a specific test, set the `SWT_SELECTED_TEST_IDS` environment
  /// variable to the ``Test/ID`` of that test (or, if multiple tests should be
  /// run, their IDs separated by `";"`.)
  ///
  /// A test ID is composed of its module name, containing type name, and (if
  /// the test is a function rather than a suite), the name of the function
  /// including parentheses and any parameter labels. For example, given the
  /// following test functions in a module named `"FoodTruckTests"`:
  ///
  /// ```swift
  /// struct CashRegisterTests {
  ///   @Test func hasCash() { ... }
  ///   @Test(arguments: Card.allCases) func acceptsCard(card: Card) { ... }
  /// }
  /// ```
  ///
  /// Their IDs are the strings `"FoodTruckTests/CashRegisterTests/hasCash()"`
  /// and `"FoodTruckTests/CashRegisterTests/acceptsCard(card:)"` respectively,
  /// and they can be passed as the environment variable value
  /// `"FoodTruckTests/CashRegisterTests/hasCash();FoodTruckTests/CashRegisterTests/acceptsCard(card:)"`.
  ///
  /// - Note: The module name of a test target in a Swift package is typically
  ///   the name of the test target.
  ///
  /// #### Filtering by tag
  ///
  /// To run only those tests with a given ``Tag``, set the `SWT_SELECTED_TAGS`
  /// environment variable to the string value of that tag. Separate multiple
  /// tags with `";"`; tests with _any_ of the specified tags will be run. For
  /// example, to run all tests tagged `"critical"` _or_ ``Tag/red`` (or both),
  /// set the value of the `SWT_SELECTED_TAGS` environment variable to
  /// `"critical;red"`.
  ///
  /// ### Configuring output
  ///
  /// By default, this function uses
  /// [ANSI escape codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code) to
  /// colorize output if the environment and platform support them. To disable
  /// colorized output, set the [`NO_COLOR`](https://www.no-color.org)
  /// environment variable.
  ///
  /// On macOS, if the SF&nbsp;Symbols app is installed, SF&nbsp;Symbols are
  /// assumed to be present in the font used for rendering within the Unicode
  /// Private Use Area. To disable the use of SF&nbsp;Symbols on macOS, set the
  /// `SWT_SF_SYMBOLS_ENABLED` environment variable to `"false"` or `"0"`.
  ///
