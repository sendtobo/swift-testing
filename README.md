## Feature overview

### Flexible test organization

Define test functions almost anywhere with a single attribute and group related
tests into hierarchies using Swift's type system.

### Customizable metadata

Dynamically enable or disable tests depending on runtime conditions, categorize
tests using tags, and associate bugs directly with the tests that verify their
fixes or reproduce their problems.

### Scalable execution

Automatically parallelize tests in-process, integrate seamlessly with Swift
concurrency, and parameterize test functions across wide ranges of inputs.
