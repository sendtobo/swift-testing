Start running tests in a new or existing XCTest-based test target.

## Overview

The testing library has experimental integration with Swift Package Manager's
`swift test` command and can be used to write and run tests alongside, or in
place of, tests written using XCTest. This document describes how to start using
the testing library to write and run tests.

To learn how to contribute to the testing library itself, see
[Contributing to `swift-testing`](https://github.com/apple/swift-testing/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Downloading a development toolchain

A recent **development snapshot** toolchain is required to use the testing
library. Visit [swift.org](https://www.swift.org/download/#trunk-development-main)
to download and install a toolchain from the section titled
**Snapshots â€” Trunk Development (main)**.

Be aware that development snapshot toolchains are not intended for day-to-day
development and may contain defects that affect the programs built with them.

### Adding the testing library as a dependency

In your package's Package.swift file, add the testing library as a dependency:

```swift
dependencies: [
  .package(url: "https://github.com/apple/swift-testing.git", branch: "main"),
],
```

To ensure that your package's deployment targets meet or exceed those of the
testing library, you may also need to specify minimum deployment targets for
macOS, iOS, watchOS, tvOS, and/or visionOS (depending on which ones your package
can be used with):

```swift
platforms: [
  .macOS(.v10_15), .iOS(.v13), .watchOS(.v6), .tvOS(.v13), .macCatalyst(.v13), .visionOS(.v1)
],
```

Then, add the testing library as a dependency of your existing test target:

```swift
.testTarget(
  name: "FoodTruckTests",
  dependencies: [
    "FoodTruck",
    .product(name: "Testing", package: "swift-testing"),
  ]
)
```

You can now add additional Swift source files to your package's test target that
contain those tests, written using the testing library, that you want to run
when you invoke `swift test` from the command line or click the
Product&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;Test menu item in Xcode.

### Configuring the environment

#### Configuring the command-line

When running macOS, the system will use the Swift toolchain included with Xcode
by default. To instruct the system to use the development toolchain you just
installed, enter the following command to configure the current command-line
session:

```sh
export TOOLCHAINS=swift
```

#### Configuring Xcode

In Xcode, open the **Xcode** menu, then the Toolchains submenu, and select the
development toolchain from the list of toolchains presented to you&mdash;it will
be presented with a name such as "Swift Development Toolchain 2023-01-01 (a)".

### Running tests

Navigate to the directory containing your package and run the following command:

```sh
swift test --enable-experimental-swift-testing
```

Swift Package Manager will build and run a test target that uses the testing
library as well as a separate target that uses XCTest. To only run tests written
using the testing library, pass `--disable-xctest` as an additional argument to
the `swift test` command.

#### Swift 5.10

As of Swift 5.10, the testing library is not integrated into Swift Package
Manager, but a temporary mechanism is provided for developers who want to start
using it with their Swift packages and the Swift 5.10 toolchain.

- Warning: This functionality is provided temporarily to aid in integrating the
testing library with existing tools such as Swift Package Manager. It will be
removed in a future release.

To use the testing library with Swift 5.10, add a new Swift source
file to your package's test target named "Scaffolding.swift". Add the following
code to it:

```swift
import XCTest
import Testing

final class AllTests: XCTestCase {
  func testAll() async {
    await XCTestScaffold.runAllTests(hostedBy: self)
  }
}
```

Navigate to the directory containing your package, and either run `swift test`
from the command line or click the Product&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;Test menu item in
Xcode.

Tests will run embedded in an `XCTestCase`-based test function named
`testAll()`. If a test fails, `testAll()` will report the failure as its own.

#### Swift 5.9 or earlier

The testing library does not support Swift 5.9 or earlier.
