Add traits to tests to annotate them or customize their behavior.

## Overview

This article describes the ``Trait``, ``TestTrait``, and ``SuiteTrait``
protocols, lists the traits provided by the testing library, and lists functions
that can be used to create them.

The ``Trait``, ``TestTrait``, and ``SuiteTrait`` protocols are used to define
types that customize the behavior of test functions and test suites.
